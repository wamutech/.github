# Wamu

A protocol and library for computation of [threshold signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem#Methodology) by multiple [decentralized identities](https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/#what-are-decentralized-identifiers).

## 🚀 Roadmap
- 📖 [Whitepaper](https://wamu.tech/whitepaper) and [Technical Specification](https://wamu.tech/specification) - ✅.
- 🔬 [PoC (Proof of Concept) library implementation (in Rust)](https://github.com/wamutech/wamu-rs) - ✅.
- ⚒️ MVP (Minimum Viable Product) library implementation (in Rust) - Q1/2024.

**NOTE:** 🚧 Wamu is still in early stages of development, check back over the next few weeks for regular updates.
